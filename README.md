## Authentication System

The application implements a robust authentication system with three methods:

![Login Screen](./1.png)

1. **Email Authentication** - Traditional email/password signup and login
2. **Google OAuth** - Single-click login using Google's authentication API
3. **LinkedIn OAuth** - Single-click login using LinkedIn's authentication API (particularly relevant as this is a LinkedIn content platform)

### MERN Implementation Approach

#### Frontend Strategy
For the frontend implementation, React provides the perfect foundation for building the authentication interfaces. The authentication flow should be structured as follows:

- Create a centralized authentication state using Redux or Context API
- Implement protected routes that redirect unauthenticated users
- Design responsive login/signup forms that support all three authentication methods
- Handle form validation client-side before submission
- Store authentication tokens securely (preferably in HTTP-only cookies)

#### Backend Strategy
Express.js serves as the backend framework with these key components:

- Passport.js as the authentication middleware, which allows for modular authentication strategies
- JWT (JSON Web Token) for stateless, secure user sessions
- bcrypt for secure password hashing to protect user credentials
- MongoDB for storing user profiles and authentication data

#### How Authentication Methods Work

1. **Email Authentication Process**:
   - User registers with email and password
   - Password is hashed with bcrypt before storage
   - On login, the provided password is hashed and compared to the stored hash
   - If successful, a JWT is generated and returned to the client

2. **Google OAuth Process**:
   - User clicks "Login with Google" button
   - Application redirects to Google's authentication servers
   - User authenticates with Google
   - Google redirects back with an authorization code
   - Backend exchanges code for user information
   - Application creates/retrieves the user and issues a JWT

3. **LinkedIn OAuth Process**:
   - Similar to Google OAuth but uses LinkedIn's authentication servers
   - Requires registration in LinkedIn Developer portal
   - Particularly valuable for this application due to LinkedIn content focus
   - Provides profile information and potentially access to LinkedIn API features

#### When and Where to Use Each Method

- **Email Authentication**: Essential as a baseline method that works for all users
- **Google OAuth**: Popular and widely used, reduces friction for users with Google accounts
- **LinkedIn OAuth**: Strategic for this application to leverage the LinkedIn ecosystem

#### Security Considerations

- Implement rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
- Use HTTPS for all authentication traffic
- Set appropriate JWT expiration times (typically 15min to 24h)
- Implement refresh token rotation for extended sessions
- Store sensitive credentials only in secure environment variables
- Conduct regular security audits of the authentication system

```

### Onboarding Steps Breakdown

#### Step 1: Workflow Selection
After authentication, users choose whether to set up a team workflow or personal workflow. If team workflow is selected, the user can invite team members by entering multiple email addresses separated by commas.

![Team Invitation](./invite.png)

**Theory and Application**: This fork in the user journey establishes personalization immediately and configures the system appropriately for different use cases. The workflow selection impacts:
- Permission structures
- UI elements shown
- Feature availability
- Data relationships in the database

**When to Implement**: This should be the first step after authentication and before any other preferences, as it fundamentally affects the user experience structure.

#### Step 2: Team Invitation (Conditional)
If team workflow is selected, users need to invite team members before proceeding.

**Theory and Application**: The invitation system uses an asynchronous, database-driven approach:
- Invitations are stored in MongoDB, not sent via email
- Email addresses are parsed and validated
- Team-to-user relationships are established upon acceptance
- This allows for a fully contained, platform-native experience

**Where to Store Invitations**: Create a dedicated collection in MongoDB with these key fields:
- Team ID (reference to the team document)
- Invitee email address
- Status (pending, accepted, declined)
- Created date
- Invited by (reference to the user who sent the invitation)

**When to Display Invitations**: Users should see pending invitations:
- Immediately after login
- On a dedicated notifications area
- Via an indicator on the user dashboard

![Invitation Notification](./invistation.png)

#### Steps 3-6: User Preferences
The following steps collect user preferences for:
- Theme (dark/light mode)
- Language (English/German)
- Post format preferences
- Posting frequency

![Language Selection](./3.png)
![Post Format Selection](./4.png)
![Posting Frequency](./5.png)

**Theory and Application**: Multi-step preference collection offers several advantages:
- Reduces cognitive load by focusing on one decision at a time
- Creates a sense of progress and engagement
- Allows the system to adapt based on earlier choices
- Builds a personalized experience before the user reaches the main interface

**Where to Store Preferences**: Create a nested preferences object within the user document in MongoDB, allowing for:
- Efficient queries (single document retrieval)
- Logical grouping of related settings
- Easy addition of new preference types without schema changes

**When to Apply Preferences**: Preferences should be:
- Applied immediately when changed
- Persisted between sessions
- Retrievable on initial application load
- Synchronized across devices

#### Step 7: Dashboard Access
After completing the onboarding flow, users access the main dashboard.

![Dashboard](./6.png)

**Theory and Application**: The main dashboard serves as the central hub for content creation and should:
- Reflect all selected preferences from the onboarding process
- Present clear pathways for content creation
- Show team activity if in team mode
- Provide easy access to key functionality

## Technical Implementation Concepts

### State Management Strategy

For a multi-step onboarding process, state management is critical. The recommended approach is:

1. **Global State Management**: 
   - Use Redux for complex state with many interconnected pieces
   - Define actions for each step of the onboarding process
   - Store the complete onboarding state in a single reducer
   - Persist state to local storage to handle page refreshes or navigation

2. **When to Update Backend**:
   - Minor preferences (theme, language): Save after each step
   - Major settings (workflow type, team): Save immediately after selection
   - Complete preference set: Synchronize at onboarding completion

3. **State Structure Design**:
   - Current step indicator
   - Completion status for each step
   - User selections at each step
   - Validation status
   - Error states

### Team Invitation System Architecture

The invitation system requires careful design to handle various scenarios:

1. **Database Schema Design**:
   - Users collection: Stores user profiles and authentication data
   - Teams collection: Defines team structure and members
   - Invitations collection: Tracks pending and processed invitations

2. **When to Check for Invitations**:
   - After each user login
   - Periodically while using the application
   - When explicitly checking notifications

3. **How to Process Acceptances**:
   - Update invitation status to "accepted"
   - Add user to team members array
   - Add team to user's teams array
   - Update permissions based on team role

4. **Edge Cases to Handle**:
   - Invitation to non-existent email
   - Multiple invitations to the same email
   - Team deletion while invitations are pending
   - User account creation after invitation

### Email Communication Architecture

While the core invitation system uses in-app notifications, email communication can be implemented as an optional feature:

1. **Service Selection Criteria**:
   | Service | When to Use | Why |
   |---------|-------------|-----|
   | SendGrid | Production applications with critical email needs | Excellent deliverability, comprehensive API, templates |
   | Mailgun | Applications with moderate email volume | Developer-friendly, good analytics |
